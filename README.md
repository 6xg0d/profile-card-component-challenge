## My process

This challenge was actually a bit complicated to me. After fixing the two problems i had, i'm pretty happy with the results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main problem to me with this challenge was the use of the "position", i'm still not used to it, so it was kinda difficult the background and the profile picture.

### Continued development

improve the css file.

Big thanks to @danielmrz-dev, a comment from him on another solution of the same challenge was really helpful to me, without that comment i'd probably still being struggling to set the background-position values haha.
